# Marcel Maas

**Engineering the visible and the invisible.**

---

### Profile
I build at the edge where **Frontend clarity** meets **Security resilience**.  
My work is defined by **precision**, **performance**, and a refusal to accept noise.  
Every interface, every line of code is treated as an asset ‚Äî designed to perform, tested to endure.

---

### Focus
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Security Mindset:** Web Application Security, Red Team approaches  
- **Philosophy:** Simplicity as leverage, resilience as baseline  

---

### Perspective
I document experiments, explore vulnerabilities, and refine the craft of building web applications.  
My ambition is not only to develop, but to set standards:  
systems that scale, interfaces that last, and architectures that do not break under pressure.
